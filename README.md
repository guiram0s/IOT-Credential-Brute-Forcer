# IoT Credential Brute-Forcer üîê

This project is a lightweight Python tool designed for **ethical hacking** and **penetration testing** of IoT and network devices using **default or weak credentials**. It scans your local network, identifies live hosts, and attempts brute-force logins over HTTP, SSH, and Telnet protocols using a known list of default usernames and passwords.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Educational Use Only**: This tool is for educational and authorized testing purposes only. Never use this tool against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

## üöÄ Features

- **Network Scanning** (Linux only): Detect live hosts on your subnet.
- **Port Scanning**: Check for common ports (22, 23, 80, 443, etc.) on discovered devices.
- **Device Identification**: Attempt hostname resolution via reverse DNS.
- **Brute Force Attacks**:
  - **HTTP Form Auth**: Smart detection of successful logins via content, redirects, cookies.
  - **SSH**: Attempts logins using Paramiko.
  - **Telnet**: Uses telnetlib to try default credentials.
- **Credential List**: Loads common default credentials from a structured JSON file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- OS: **Linux** (for network scanning via `ip` and `ping`)
- Python: 3.6+
- Dependencies:
  - `requests`
  - `paramiko`

### üì¶ Install

1. **Clone the repo**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/iot-bruteforcer.git
   cd iot-bruteforcer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the tool**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

## üìò How It Works

1. **Discover Devices**: Performs a ping sweep of the local subnet.
2. **Scan Ports**: Identifies open ports on each host.
3. **Identify Device**: Attempts to resolve the hostname.
4. **Brute-Force Protocols**:
   - HTTP: You will be prompted to enter the login field names you can use BurpSuite or Developer Tools to know, if not you can leave the fields empty and it will use general settings but it is advisable to look for the target's variable's names before running (e.g., `username`, `password`).
   - SSH & Telnet: Uses default credentials from the provided list.

## üîí Notes

- **Modular Design**: Each brute-force module is independent and extendable.
- **Custom Credential Lists**: You can expand `defaults/common_credentials.json` with more usernames/passwords.
- **Smart HTTP Brute**: Compares login response with a baseline of failed attempts to infer successful login heuristically.
